<p>webtuesday is a monthly meeting of IT professionals (nerds) in / near Zürich. The format is normally a 1 hour talk followed by drinks near by.</p>

<h2 id="helping_out">Helping Out</h2>
<p>webtuesday is effectively cost free - it costs nothing to attend and has no direct costs to run. Help and input is needed though - see <a href="/contact/">how to get in touch</a> if you can do something for webtuesday.</p>

<h3 id="venues_places_to_meet">Venues / Places to Meet</h3>
<p>One of webtuesday's &quot;features&quot; is we always meet at someone's office, in or around Zürich and that we try to pick a different office each time.</p>

<p>To date, companies which have helped out include (in no particular order) <a href="http://www.liip.ch">Liip</a>, <a href="http://search.ch">search.ch</a>, <a href="http://namics.com">Namics</a>, <a href="http://www.eurospider.com/">Eurospider</a>, <a href="http://tilllate.com">tilllate</a>, <a href="http://amiado.com">Amiado</a> and <a href="http://shiftthink.com">shiftTHINK</a> and quite some more.</p>

<p>Right now this is the biggest problem - peak attendance is ~35 people and average probably around ~25 so webtuesday is getting too big for the average meeting room. There also needs to be a reasonable drinks location nearby, able to cope with that kind of crowd.</p>

<h3 id="talk_topics">Talk Topics</h3>
<p>Always on the look out for interesting talks. Some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It should be something you have first hand experience of / work with professionally / are involved in developing etc.</li>
    <li>Topics are typically web-related although could be indirectly related e.g. &quot;clustering&quot;</li>
    <li>Open ends for discussion are worth having</li>
    <li>Aim for 1 hour max.</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting 2007 we're trying to get webtuesday talks online somewhere like Google or Yahoo video, currently thanks to hard work from <a href="/members/cocaman">Corsin</a>. First success online <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4128376925493931336&amp;hl=en">here</a> (<a href="http://cocaman.ch/wp/2007/01/webtuesday-openid-distributed-authentication-the-video">details</a>).</p>
<p>If you can help out there, please  <a href="/contact/">contact</a> <a href="http://camichel.com/">Corsin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spreading_the_word">Spreading the Word</h3>
<p>Right now this isn't really a problem - attendance is &quot;just right&quot; at the moment - any bigger and it starts to become a monthly conference.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/webtuesday/">images on Flickr</a> or <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/webtuesday">blogging</a> is much appreciated.</p>

<h2>Agenda</h2>

<h3>CoffeeScript - Hijacking JavaScript</h3>

<p><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> is a nice little programming language™ that aims to bring out the good parts of JavaScript while mixing in some great concepts and syntax sugar from languages like Ruby and Python. The best part: it runs in all browsers – today – and the compiled source is human-readable and actually quite nice to read.</p>

<p>We'll take a good look at the language and it's features to see what's so powerful about it. We'll also take a brief look behind the scenes at the parser generator <a href="http://zaach.github.com/jison/">Jison</a> that makes this language and others like it possible. To round things off, we'll discuss the value of what I'd call Trojan horse languages such as CoffeeScript and how they can drive innovation while not breaking the web.</p>

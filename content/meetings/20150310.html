<h2>Webtuesday March: Talking to Machines</h2>
<p>Okay, Computer: Do-you-hear-me? Hello? No response. We all know the flaws and frustrations that come with speech interfaces. But thanks to deep learning algorithms, even browsers became significantly better in recognizing our voice. Good enough?</p>
<p>In this talk I want to share my experiences in designing my very own personal assistant. Not only knows it how I articulate myself, but also what data sources I like to get my information from. This talk will both cover design decisions and the implementation side with JavaScript. But kids: don’t try this in public.</p>

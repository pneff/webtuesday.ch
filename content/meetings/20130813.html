<h2>Javascript tools to inspire your projects</h2>

<p>There is so many new javascript tools lately. So many that we can't keep up. We usually never get a real chance to try them out and we forget about them really fast.</p>

<p>The idea of the talk is to inspire your current and future projects.</p>

<p>We will go through the latest javascript tools that could simplify your code or enhance your products. We'll look at as many as we can in 45min. For each of them we'll spend max 2-3min to learn what they are good at and look at a short example.</p>

Here a few examples to give you a feeling:

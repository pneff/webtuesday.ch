<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>
    We'll have a look at the Free Software RDBMS <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> of which Version 9.2 has just been released. We'll see how to easily get it running and how it compares to other free RDBMS out there.
</p>
<p>
    Aside of looking at some of the new stuff, we'll see how nice it is to have access to some of the awesome features in Postgres like transactional DDL, or lock-free ALTER TABLE's. Oh and did you know that you can run JavaScript right in your database?
</p>

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>
	<a href="http://swisstrains.ch">Swisstrains.ch</a> is a simulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Railways" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Railways</a> network, simulation that is based on the SBB timetables and railroad vector data (track lines and stations) of Switzerland. The project remained frozen for almost 4 years but it was mid 2011 when a <a href="http://simcity.vasile.ch/sbb/">new version</a> kicked off with faster, better UX and enriched features.
</p> 
<p>
	The figures behind the project are quite impressive: the railroad network has more than 5,000 km in length, inside which run daily cca. 13,000 trains that generates 150,000 timetables stops accross 1,800 stations. <a href="https://github.com/vasile/vehicle-simulator">Vehicle simulator</a> powers the new version and during the talk you will get a short demo about how to use it in order to create your own public transport simulation but also you will hear about the motivation behind the project, the challenges encountered, the technology stack used and what are the next steps.

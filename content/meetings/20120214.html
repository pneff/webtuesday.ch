<h2>Agenda</h2>

<p><a href="http://seld.be/">Jordi Boggiano</a> presents Dependency Management with Composer</p>

<p><a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> is a new PHP dependency manager. It resolves and downloads the packages your project requires.</p>

<p>We will learn how to use Composer to easily manage the libraries and other packages you use. We will go through the basics of dependency management and then move on towards publishing your own packages, be it open source ones or closed company code that is used by multiple projects.</p>

<h2>Webtuesday April: Lightning talks edition!</h2>
<p>The beloved lightning talks format is back! We will meet on the 14th of April to listen to up to 5 people sharing their knowledge about anything related to the web development world.</p>

<h2>The principle?</h2>
<p>
Each speaker gets 10mins, a beamer (if needed) and the attention of the crowd.
</p>
<p>
The only hard rule is about the time. After 10min, the speaker will be stopped and the stage given to the next speaker.
</p>

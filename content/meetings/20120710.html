<h3>Terrific Concept</h3>
<p>First we'll get an overview over the modularization approach of <a href="http://terrifically.org/">Terrific</a>. This will lead us to the
    two main projects of Terrific – <a href="http://terrifically.org/api/">TerrificJS</a> & <a href="http://terrifically.org/composer/">Terrific Composer</a></p>

<h3>TerrificJS</h3>
<p><a href="http://terrifically.org/api/">TerrificJS</a> is a nice little JavaScript framework – based on jQuery – that helps you to modularize your JavaScript code in a very natural way.</p>
<p>We'll take a look at the concepts and features of TerrificJS to see how it helps you to reduce frontend complexity.</p>

<h3>Terrific Composer</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://terrifically.org/composer/">Terrific Composer</a> is a Frontend Development Framework that aims to make your life easier. It takes the modularization approach of Terrific and provides you a project
    structure that enables you to start right away.</p>

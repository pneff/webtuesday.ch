<p>We meet at 19:30. The location hasn't been assigned yet.</p>

<h2>7 languages in 49 minutes</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>We know that your favorite programming language is the best one and there is no doubt in that.</li>
    <li>but, can you give our speakers 7 minutes to inspire you into changing the perspective.</li>
    <li>or, discuss about why would you change perspective before all and how it can benefit you and your organization.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each of 7 speakers will have just 7 minutes to present you the selected essentials of a programming language and the culture that surrounds it. Putting such a hard constraint on time will hopefully lead speakers to extracting the most crucial elements of their passion and why would you be interested in getting your share of it.</p>

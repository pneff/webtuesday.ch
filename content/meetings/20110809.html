abstract: bitcoinJS - Money, Danger and JavaScript
---

<p>We meet at 19:30 at <a href="http://tel.local.ch/ZH/Liip">Liip</a>, Feldstrasse 133.</p> 

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>BitcoinJS is a set of open-source libraries designed to let you quickly realize your custom <a href="http://weusecoins.com/">Bitcoin</a> project. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency and has been called the "most dangerous open source project in history", so this promises to be interesting in a number of ways.
</p>
<p>Lead developer Stefan Thomas will introduce the underlying concepts and give an in-depth tour of the project and its use of server-side JavaScript with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>.</p>

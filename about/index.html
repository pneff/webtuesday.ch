                <p>Webtuesday is a monthly meeting of web professionals (nerds) in / near Zürich. The format is normally a 1 hour talk followed by drinks nearby. Webtuesday is said to be toughest IT audience around.</p>

<h2 id="helping_out">Helping Out</h2>
<p>Webtuesday is effectively cost free - it costs nothing to attend and has no direct costs to run. Help and input is needed though - see <a href="/contact/">how to get in touch</a> if you can do something for webtuesday.</p>

<h3 id="venues_places_to_meet">Venues / Places to Meet</h3>
<p>One of webtuesday's &quot;features&quot; is we always meet at someone's office, in or around Zürich and that we try to pick a different office each time.</p>

<p>To date, companies which have helped out include (in no particular order) <a href="http://www.liip.ch">Liip</a>, <a href="http://www.local.ch/">Local.ch</a>,  <a href="http://namics.com">Namics</a>, <a href="http://search.ch">search.ch</a> and quite some more.</p>

<p>Right now this is the biggest problem - peak attendance is ~50 people and average probably around ~25 so webtuesday is getting too big for the average meeting room. There also needs to be a reasonable drinks location nearby, able to cope with that kind of crowd.</p>

<p>If you can help, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.

<h3 id="talk_topics">Talk Topics</h3>
<p>Always on the look out for interesting talks. Some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It should be something you have first hand experience of / work with professionally / are involved in developing etc.</li>
    <li>Topics are typically web-related although could be indirectly related e.g. &quot;clustering&quot;</li>
    <li>Open ends for discussion are worth having</li>
    <li>Aim for 1 hour max.</li>
</ul>

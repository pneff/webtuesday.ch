<p>Organising a webtuesday means doing the following (read - this is how it's worked the past couple of years - change it for the better);</p>
<p>You can simply start organizing a webtuesday for the <a href="/meetings/">free dates</a>. Make sure you ping <a href="http://twitter.com/webtuesday">@webtuesday</a> about your intentions to make sure the date is still free.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Find a date - webtuesday always happens on the 2nd Tuesday of the month</li>
    <li>Update the page for the given meeting
        <ul>
            <li>Edit or create the event page using the <a href="https://github.com/pneff/webtuesday.ch">git repository</a></li>
            <li>note the URL carefully</li>
            <li>easiest thing is to copy the source of an existing page, copy and paste</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Find a speaker
        <ul>
            <li>normally do this well ahead of time (e.g. a month or more)</li>
            <li>talks are normally ~50minutes</li>
            <li>ideally topic should be something the speaker actually does / has experience of</li>
            <li>around 1-2 weeks before the event start "nagging" for the talk title, add to wiki page and other platforms</li>
            <li>this assumes you want to go with a 1-talk format</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Find a location (as early as possible before the event)
        <ul>
            <li>option a) get in touch with somewhere where webtuesday has been before - Namics in particular have been kind enough to offer to host webtuesday pretty much any time - talk to JÃ¼rg Stuker</li>
            <li>option b) find a new location...
                <ul>
                    <li>Needs to be able to fit at least 30</li>
                    <li>Ideally the office of someone who attends webtuesday</li>
                    <li>Another option: Christian Stocker would be able to sort out space at Uni ZH but so far have always avoided it - find that location too "studenty", which isn't really the webtuesday vibe. Axel Beckert once tried to get space at ETH, but being a non-ETH event, we would have to pay rent for the room, so this is probably no option.</li>
                    <li>So far have applied a rule of no requirement for personal costs for anyone involved (i.e. paying for space, paying for food/drinks)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Announce... places I've done this in the past, depending on motivation that month...
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Required</strong> <a href="http://techup.ch/tag/webtuesday">techup.ch</a></li>
            <li><strong>Required</strong> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webtuesday-announce">announcements mailing list</a> believe this acts as a reminder for many - usually try to do this in the week before webtuesday, so give bloggers a chance to make noise (although the bloggers are pretty lazy re: webtuesday these days ;))</li>
            <li><a href="http://twitter.com/webtuesday">@webtuesday on Twitter</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://upcoming.org/">upcoming.org</a> - this has actually helped quite a few find webtuesday</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Find somewhere for post-event drinks - generally places that "suck" are better than Zurichs most love nightspots, before you'll easily fit 30 people there and loud music is just annoying in this context. Give the place a warning by calling in advance. Everywhere where webtuesday has been before is listed here.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest is hopefully obvious.</p>
